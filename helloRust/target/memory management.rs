/* what is memory management 

Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory, allocating portions to various tasks and freeing it when no longer needed. It ensures that a computer's memory is used efficiently and effectively, preventing memory leaks and crashes. In programming languages like Rust, memory management is crucial for performance and safety, as it helps avoid common issues like dangling pointers and buffer overflows.
