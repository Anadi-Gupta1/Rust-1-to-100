üîπ 9. Mutability, Memory Management, Ownership
‚úÖ Mutability

By default in Rust, variables are immutable (cannot be changed).

If you want to change them, you must explicitly use mut.

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    // x = 6; ‚ùå ERROR: x is immutable

    let mut y = 10;
    y = 20; // ‚úÖ works because of "mut"
    println!("y is {}", y); // y is 20
}


üëâ Rule: Rust forces you to be clear when changing values, so bugs are fewer.

‚úÖ Ownership

Rust has a unique way to manage memory safely (no garbage collector, no manual free).

Rules of Ownership:

Each value in Rust has one owner.

When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped (freed).

You can only have one active owner of a value at a time.

Example:

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // ownership moved to s2

    // println!("{}", s1); ‚ùå ERROR: s1 no longer owns the value
    println!("{}", s2); // ‚úÖ prints hello
}


üëâ When you do let s2 = s1;, the ownership moves from s1 ‚Üí s2.
This avoids double-free errors.

‚úÖ Memory Management

Stack: for fixed-size, fast values (i32, f64, etc.)

Heap: for dynamic, growable values (String, Vec, etc.)

Example:

fn main() {
    let a = 10; // stored on stack
    let b = String::from("Rust"); // stored on heap, but pointer on stack
}


Rust automatically frees memory when the owner goes out of scope.

fn main() {
    {
        let s = String::from("world");
        println!("{}", s);
    } // s goes out of scope ‚Üí memory is freed here
}

üîπ 10. Referencing & Borrowing

Since only one owner exists, how can you let multiple parts of your code use the same data?
üëâ That‚Äôs where references (&) and borrowing come in.

‚úÖ Immutable Borrowing
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // borrow immutably
    let r2 = &s; // borrow immutably again
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);

    // s can still be used
    println!("owner: {}", s);
}


üëâ Multiple immutable borrows are allowed at the same time.

‚úÖ Mutable Borrowing
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s; // borrow mutably
    r1.push_str(" world");

    println!("{}", r1);
}


üëâ Only one mutable borrow at a time is allowed.
This prevents data races.

‚ùå Not allowed:

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s; // ‚ùå ERROR: cannot borrow twice mutably
}

‚úÖ Mix immutable & mutable references

You cannot mix them at the same time:

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; 
    let r2 = &s; // multiple immutable okay

    // let r3 = &mut s; // ‚ùå ERROR: cannot borrow as mutable while immutables exist
}

‚úÖ Real-World Example: String Length
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len() // borrow s immutably
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("'{}' has length {}", s, len);
}


üëâ Ownership is not transferred, just borrowed, so s is still valid in main.

‚úÖ Real-World Example: Modify a Value
fn add_exclamation(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str("!");
}

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("Rust");
    add_exclamation(&mut s);
    println!("{}", s); // Rust!
}


üëâ Here s is mutably borrowed inside the function, modified, and returned safely.

üéØ Quick Analogy

Think of ownership like house ownership:

Only one person can legally own the house (s1).

If they sell it (let s2 = s1), they no longer own it.

Borrowing is like lending the keys:

Immutable borrow ‚Üí "You can look at my house, but don‚Äôt change anything."

Mutable borrow ‚Üí "You can live in my house, but only one person at a time."

‚ö° Now: do you want me to make a step-by-step flowchart/diagram (like boxes + arrows) to visually show ownership, borrowing, mutability in action?

Awesome ‚Äî let‚Äôs go deep, but keep it super clear. We‚Äôll cover:

Mutability

Ownership (and memory: stack vs heap, move/copy/clone, drops)

Referencing & borrowing (immutable/mutable, mixing rules, lifetimes)

Idioms, pitfalls, and ‚Äúwhy this error happens‚Äù with fixes

I‚Äôll use many tiny, runnable examples. You can paste each fn main() into rustc/Playground and see the compiler‚Äôs messages.

1) Mutability (what mut really means)
1.1 Variable bindings are immutable by default
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    // x = 6; // ‚ùå error: cannot assign to `x`, as it is not declared as mutable

    let mut y = 10;
    y = 20; // ‚úÖ ok
    println!("{y}");
}

1.2 Mutability is about the binding, not the value‚Äôs type

mut says: ‚Äúthis binding may change (reassign or mutate through it).‚Äù

Many mutating methods require &mut self. To call them, the binding must be mut.

fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2];
    v.push(3); // needs &mut self ‚Üí binding must be `mut`
    println!("{v:?}");
}


If the binding isn‚Äôt mut, you can‚Äôt call methods taking &mut self:

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2];
    // v.push(3); // ‚ùå cannot borrow as mutable
}

1.3 Shadowing vs mutability

Shadowing creates a new binding with the same name.

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1; // shadow (new x), still immutable
    let x = "six"; // can even change type with shadowing
    println!("{x}");
}


Use mut when you want to change the same variable; use shadowing when you want a new binding (possibly new type or transformed value).

1.4 mut in patterns & params
fn takes(mut s: String) {
    s.push_str("!");      // ok: the local binding `s` is mutable
    println!("{s}");
} // `s` dropped here

fn main() {
    let msg = String::from("hi");
    takes(msg);           // ownership moved into `takes`
    // println!("{msg}"); // ‚ùå moved
}


mut s: String makes the local parameter binding mutable; it doesn‚Äôt affect the caller.

1.5 Mutability of references vs. mutability of the binding
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let mut r = &x;  // r is a mutable *binding* pointing to an immutable value
    println!("{r}");
    let y = 6;
    r = &y;          // ok: r can be reassigned to point elsewhere
    println!("{r}");
}


The above does not allow changing x or y (they‚Äôre immutable). It only allows r to be reassigned.

2) Ownership & Memory (stack/heap, move/copy/clone, Drop)

Rust has no GC. Memory safety is enforced by the ownership system at compile time.

2.1 Stack vs Heap (simple mental model)

Stack: fixed-size, fast (e.g., i32, bool, tuples of fixed-size types).

Heap: growable/dynamic (e.g., String, Vec<T>, Box<T>). A stack ‚Äúhandle‚Äù points to heap data.

fn main() {
    let a = 10;                      // stack
    let s = String::from("hello");   // stack handle + heap buffer
    // s: { ptr -> heap, len, capacity } (all 3 are on stack; buffer on heap)
}

2.2 Three ownership rules

Every value has exactly one owner.

When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.

Ownership can move.

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hi");
    let s2 = s1; // move: s1 ‚Üí s2
    // println!("{s1}"); // ‚ùå s1 is invalid now
    println!("{s2}");    // ‚úÖ
}


Why move? To prevent double-free. Only one owner frees the heap once.

2.3 Copy types don‚Äôt move, they copy bitwise

Types like i32, u64, bool, char, f64, and tuples of only Copy types implement Copy.

Assigning them copies the value; the original remains valid.

fn main() {
    let a = 5;
    let b = a; // copy, not move
    println!("{a}, {b}"); // ‚úÖ both usable
}


String and Vec<T> are NOT Copy because they manage heap memory.

2.4 clone() for deep copies of heap data
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone(); // deep copy heap buffer
    println!("{s1}, {s2}"); // ‚úÖ both valid
}


Use clone() when you truly need two owned copies (costs allocations).
‚úÖ Memory Management

Stack: for fixed-size, fast values (i32, f64, etc.)

Heap: for dynamic, growable values (String, Vec, etc.)

Example:

fn main() {
    let a = 10; // stored on stack
    let b = String::from("Rust"); // stored on heap, but pointer on stack
}


Rust automatically frees memory when the owner goes out of scope.

fn main() {
    {
        let s = String::from("world");
        println!("{}", s);
    } // s goes out of scope ‚Üí memory is freed here
}

üëâ That‚Äôs where references (&) and borrowing come in.

‚úÖ Immutable Borrowing
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // borrow immutably
    let r2 = &s; // borrow immutably again
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);

    // s can still be used
    println!("owner: {}", s);
}


üëâ Multiple immutable borrows are allowed at the same time.

‚úÖ Mutable Borrowing
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s; // borrow mutably
    r1.push_str(" world");

    println!("{}", r1);
}


üëâ Only one mutable borrow at a time is allowed.
This prevents data races.

‚ùå Not allowed:

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s; // ‚ùå ERROR: cannot borrow twice mutably
}

‚úÖ Mix immutable & mutable references

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len() // borrow s immutably
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("'{}' has length {}", s, len);
}


üëâ Ownership is not transferred, just borrowed, so s is still valid in main.

‚úÖ Real-World Example: Modify a Value
fn add_exclamation(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str("!");
}

    add_exclamation(&mut s);
    println!("{}", s); // Rust!
}


üëâ Here s is mutably borrowed inside the function, modified, and returned safely.
