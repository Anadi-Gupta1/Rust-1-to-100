What is error handling

Error handling is the process of responding to and managing errors that occur during the execution of a program. In Rust, error handling is primarily done using the `Result` and `Option` types, which allow developers to express and handle potential errors in a safe and explicit manner.

The `Result` type is used for functions that can return an error. It is an enum with two variants: `Ok`, which indicates success and contains the result value, and `Err`, which indicates failure and contains an error value. This allows functions to return detailed error information without panicking.

The `Option` type is used for values that may be absent. It is also an enum with two variants: `Some`, which contains a value, and `None`, which indicates the absence of a value. This is useful for situations where a value may or may not be present, such as searching for an item in a collection.

Rust encourages developers to handle errors explicitly, making it clear when a function can fail and requiring the caller to deal with the potential error. This leads to more robust and reliable code.


What is compilation
compilation means when we convert the high level code into the binary code is called compilation.

what is compilation error 
compilation error refers to when we converting the high level code into the binary code and there is an error in the code like borrow error then it is called compilation error.


what is try catch block in typescript

Try catch block in typescript means that 


try {
    // code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
    // handle the error
}

try {
    const data =  fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf8');
    console.error('Error reading file:', error);
}


what is generics in typescript and in rust and in general

Generics are a way to create reusable components that can work with any data type. They allow developers to write flexible and type-safe code by parameterizing types.

In TypeScript, generics are used to create functions, classes, and interfaces that can operate on different types without losing type information. For example, a generic function can take a parameter of any type and return a value of the same type:

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}
```

In Rust, generics are also used to create flexible and reusable code. Rust's generics are similar to those in TypeScript, allowing functions and data structures to operate on different types. For example, a generic function in Rust can be defined as follows:

```rust
fn identity<T>(arg: T) -> T {
    arg
}
```

In general, generics provide a way to write code that is more abstract and reusable, while still maintaining type safety. They are a powerful feature in both TypeScript and Rust, enabling developers to create more flexible and maintainable code.
