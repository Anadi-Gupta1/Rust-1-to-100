# ðŸš€ AUTOMATIC BINARY DETECTION:
# Any .rs file you put in src/bin/ will automatically become a binary
# No need to modify this Cargo.toml file anymore!
# 
# How to use:
# 1. Put your new .rs file in: src/bin/yourfile.rs
# 2. Run with: cargo run --bin yourfile
#
# Legacy binaries (you can move these to src/bin/ if you want):
